# How to Start the App

This project contains a React front-end application and a Node.js back-end server built with **Express** and **TypeScript**. The front-end is built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Sass** for styling. Follow the instructions below to start the app.

## Starting the Server (Node.js) 
1. Open terminal window and navigate to the `server` directory:

```bash

cd server
``` 
2. Install the dependencies by running:

```

npm install
``` 
3. Start the server by running:

```sql

npm start
```



This will launch the Node.js server at `http://localhost:3001`.

Note: The server must be running in order for the React app to fetch data from it.

## Starting the Client (React) App 
1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `client` directory:

```bash

cd client
``` 
2. Install the dependencies by running:

```
npm install
``` 
3. Start the development server by running:

```sql

npm start
```



This will launch the React app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
